       		I began my counseling practice to assist <br/>
			others in finding a holistic way to deal with <br/>
			life stressors. I have been in the healing <br/>
			business for over 10 years. My journey began<br/>
			with assisting others in a hospital setting, as a <br/>
			Spiritual Leader (Chaplain), often bringing <br/>
            comfort to those in their final days, or <br/>
            empowering the loved ones left behind. <br/>
            In those experiences and many more I <br/>
            developed a love for counseling others. <br/>
            <br/><br/>
            Bey worked hard to attain his goal of being <br/>
            licensed by the State of Florida as a Licensed <br/>
            Mental Health Counselor. He now provides <br/>
            individual services, family services and <br/>
            life coaching. His unique style of utilizing <br/>
            <a href="http://www.nacbt.org/">CBT</a>, <a href="http://www.albertellis.org">REBT</a>, Emotional and Spiritually based<br/>

            fears and problems and bring solutions to their<br/>
             issues.	             <br/>
